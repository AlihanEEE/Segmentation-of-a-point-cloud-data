# Segmentation of Point Cloud Data

## Introduction
This project focuses on the segmentation of point cloud data, an essential step in processing 3D point clouds. It involves dividing a cloud of points into segments that represent individual objects or parts of an environment, using C++.

## Methodologies
Use machine learning for data labeling and clustering for unsupervised segmentation.

## Technical Details
C++ with PCL for data processing and CMake for build management.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/AlihanEEE/Segmentation-of-a-point-cloud-data
cd Segmentation-of-a-point-cloud-data
g++ -o segmentation main.cpp

## Usage
Run the segmentation executable and provide the necessary input files or parameters as required by the program's prompts.

## Features
Implements efficient segmentation algorithms for point cloud data.
Allows for the processing of large datasets.
Supports various segmentation techniques tailored to different applications.
